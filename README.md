## My personal portfolio website

My own slice of the internet where I can offer my skills for those who need to establish a web presence. 

[Jamal Park Site](https://jamalpark.netlify.app/)

## How It's Made:
This is a pretty straighforward static site with most emphasis placed on copy and layout.

## Lessons Learned:
How to utilize forms and make sure they route correctly. 

Tweaking CSS to get the feel that I was looking for took more time than I anticipated. 

Love how it all came together.
